Step 1 : Go to github official documentation for creating SSH key "https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent"

step 2 : open gitbash or any terminal of your choice #ex:(powershell in VS Code)

step 3 : copy this command from the documentation "ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com" 
              # use your email which you used for github account
        and paste it.
        It will ask you this : Enter file in which to save the key (C:\Users\govad/.ssh/id_ed25519): #leave it blank and just hit Enter
        It will ask for Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):  #just hit enter
        it will give you the key fingerprint #generates a new key   #we have created a ssh key for the email

step 4 : Add a new SSH key using this command 
            #for Mac :"pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub" , for windows: "cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub | clip"
        It means the ssh key has been copied now and you can paste it anywhere
step 5 : Now go to your github account and go to settings on the right side, SSH and GPG keys
        Paste the SSH Key and click add new SSH key
step 6 : now go back to yourvscode and clone repository #git clone""
        clone is successfull
        and now you can clone any repositories using the ssh key, you can make changes, you can commit changes and push the code
